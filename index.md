# Welcome

The EuroSys conference series brings together professionals from academia and industry. It has a strong focus on systems research and development: operating systems, data base systems, real-time systems and middleware for networked, distributed, parallel, or embedded computing systems. EuroSys has become a premier forum for discussing various issues of systems software research and development, including implications related to hardware and applications.

EuroSys’17 will follow the pattern established by the previous EuroSys conferences, by seeking papers on all aspects of computer systems. EuroSys’17 will also include a number of workshops to allow junior and senior members of the systems community to explore leading-edge topics and ideas before they are presented at a conference.
