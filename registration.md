## NEW! Childcare

Eurosys, in cooperation with ACM SIGOPS, is pleased to offer, for the first time, complimentary childcare at Eurosys 2017. Space is limited and the service is assured, in the conference hotel, during workshop/conference presentations, coffee-breaks and lunches. Please contact us first if you wish the childcare service during social events.

Please indicate the number and the age of children you will bring during the registration process, as well as desired time of the day for childcare for each day of the workshops/conference (Sunday - Wednesday). We will then contact you with details.

**Please note:** Due to organizational and space limitations, late registrants (i.e., those registering after March 31st) are unlikely to be able to benefit from the childcare service.
