# Call for papers <small><a href="/assets/data/Eurosys2017-CFP.pdf"><img src="/assets/img/pdf.png"/></a></small>

The European Conference on Computer Systems (EuroSys) is a premier international forum for presenting computer systems research, broadly construed. EuroSys 2017 seeks papers on all areas of computer systems research, including: 

*	Cloud computing and datacenter systems
*	Database systems and data analytics frameworks
*	Operating systems
*	Virtualization and virtualized systems
*	File and storage systems
*	Distributed systems
*	Mobile and pervasive systems
*	Networked systems
*	Dependable systems
*	Language support and runtime systems
*	Parallelism, concurrency, and multicore systems
*	Real-time, embedded, and cyber-physical systems
*	Secure systems, privacy, and anonymity-preserving systems
*	Tracing, analysis, and transformation of systems

We encourage papers that span different topics and communities.  We also welcome experience papers that clearly articulate lessons learned and papers that refute prior published results. Papers will be judged on novelty, significance, correctness, and clarity. Preference will be given to papers with innovative ideas and new approaches over papers with incremental results on well-established problems. Papers will be provisionally accepted and final acceptance will be subject to shepherding by a member of the program committee. 

Reviewing will be double-blind, meaning the authors' identities will be hidden from the reviewers. EuroSys applies ACM's policies for plagiarism, submission confidentiality, reviewer anonymity, and prior and concurrent paper submission.

## Submission information

**The deadline for submitting the final version of the papers is Friday, October 21st, 23:59 CEST (ZÃ¼rich time). There will be no extensions.**

Submissions should be made online at <a href="https://eusys17.ethz.ch/" target="_blank">https://eusys17.ethz.ch/</a>. Submissions should be no longer than 12 pages including all content, except references. Papers must be formatted using 10pt font, single spacing (minimum 11pt spacing between lines), two columns with 0.33 inches between columns, and a text box of 7 by 9 inches. Please ensure that the pages are numbered. Authors should use [this version](http://eurosys16.doc.ic.ac.uk/calls/papers/sigplanconf-eurosys.cls) of the SIGPLAN template, which has been modified to use 10pt font, and specify the "preprint" option to achieve the required formatting. Reviewing will be double-blind, so papers must not identify the authors. In place of the authors' names, please indicate the paper ID number assigned when registering the paper, along with the total number of pages in the submission. When referring to your own previous work, you should use the third person. Papers that violate the submission guidelines will be rejected regardless of their merit. Accepted papers will be allowed 14 pages in the proceedings, plus references. Authors who have questions about their submission can contact the PC co-chairs at [eusys17@inf.ethz.ch](mailto:eusys17@inf.ethz.ch).


<!---
Full submission details will appear online on the conference Web site ([http://2017.eurosys.org](http://2017.eurosys.org)).

In addition to paper presentations, EuroSys 2017 will have a poster session. Submissions for posters will open closer to the conference deadline. Accepted papers will automatically qualify for the poster session, and authors will be strongly encouraged to participate.

<!---
Authors who are unsure whether or not their submissions might meet these guidelines, or with specific questions about the guidelines, are welcome to contact the program committee co-chairs, via [eusys17@inf.ethz.ch](mailto:eusys17@inf.ethz.ch).
