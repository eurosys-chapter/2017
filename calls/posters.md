# Call for Posters

The poster session provides a great opportunity to engage with attendees about your EuroSys'17 paper, or to present early-stage work. In previous years, the poster sessions have been a vibrant and collegial forum for discussing new ideas, elaborating on material presented in the talks, and meeting new people from the systems community. We anticipate that this year's poster session will build on this track record.

## Important Deadlines

## Submission Instructions

Poster submissions consist of two pages. The first page of the submission should be an extended abstract using the same formatting guidelines as a full EuroSys'17 submission (10pt font, single spacing, minimum 11pt spacing between lines, two columns with 0.33 inches between columns, and a text box of 7 by 9 inches). The second page of the submission should be a draft of the proposed poster. The extended abstracts will be published on the EuroSys'17 website at the time of the conference unless authors request otherwise.
Submissions must include a title, author names and affiliations, a note indicating which authors (if any) are students, and an indication of which author will present the poster. Posters can be accompanied by a demo of a preliminary version of the system or technique described in the submission.

Submit your two-page poster abstract and draft through the Poster Submission Website at <a href="https://eurosys17posters.hotcrp.com">https://eurosys17posters.hotcrp.com</a>

All poster submissions will be reviewed by the Poster and Demo Program Committee. Accepted posters must be presented by at least one of the authors during the poster session at the conference. Each presenter will have three minutes to present their work to a three-person jury. The jury will select the recipient of the <b>Best Poster Award</b> based on these three-minute presentations.
