# Call for Shadow PC Participation

Eurosys is organizing a shadow program committee for the EuroSys 2017 conference
under the sponsorship of EuroSys. If you are interested in participating, please
send an e-mail to the Shadow PC co-chairs: Allen Clement (Google, aclement -at- gmail dot com) and 
Vivien Quéma (INP Grenoble, vivien dot quema -at- imag dot fr) before September 30th 2016. Please include a short 
paragraph describing your current research, areas of expertise, and 
publications: this will help us with selecting candidates and assigning papers 
for review. Please also get in touch if you have any queries.

## Principle


Being on a shadow PC is an excellent opportunity for young systems researchers
(PhD students, post-docs and new faculty members) to get experience in community
service, i.e., programme committee practices.


Shadow PC members are expected to write their own detailed and rigorous reviews 
for their assigned papers. We expect a review load of 15–20 papers per member. 
Members especially those based in Europe are also expected to attend a one-day 
shadow PC meeting in person: this will be in Zürich, Switzerland. Members will 
be responsible for their own travel and accommodation for the PC meeting. 
EuroSys has some limited funds that we will use for travel grants to help with 
the costs of this; please contact Allen Clement and Vivien Quéma for more 
details.


The EuroSys shadow PC will follow roughly the same timeline as the main PC 
(http://2017.eurosys.org/). We plan to have the shadow PC meeting close in time 
to the main PC meeting (week of January 16-20, 2017) and in the same place 
(Zürich). We are also planning a one-day workshop in Zürich that week to which 
both shadow and main PC members are invited.


Being a member of a shadow PC is a lot of work without any recognition. However,
it is also very rewarding and worthwhile for a number of reasons, including:


  - Getting to know how a PC is run and how it operates.
  - Seeing how more experienced reviewers judge the same papers that you review.
  - Getting to see both strong and weak papers at the submission stage.
  - Discovering what it takes to publish a paper in a highly selective 
    conference such as EuroSys.
  - Having a chance to read top-notch papers in your area of expertise before 
    they are published.
  - Submitting high quality reviews makes one a possible candidate for future 
    PCs.
  - Discussing the papers with one or more EuroSys PC members who will attend 
    the shadow meeting.
  - Getting to know other shadow PC members.
